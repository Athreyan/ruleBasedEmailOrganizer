# ruleBasedEmailOrganizer
This Python script automates email organization tasks by integrating with the Gmail API and PostgreSQL database. It fetches emails from Gmail, stores them in a PostgreSQL database, and applies user-defined rules to perform actions such as marking emails as read, moving them to specific labels, or filtering based on conditions.
